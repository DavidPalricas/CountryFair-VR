# 🔍 Overview

CountryFair VR is a VR serious game designed to enhance post-stroke rehabilitation through immersive, gamified exercises targeting upper-limb motor recovery. The project targets **Meta Quest 3** with hand-tracking support and was developed in **Unity 6000.2.5f1**. It features two rehabilitation mini-games set within an interactive country fair hub (`CountryFair.unity`) with 3D spatial audio, and incorporates a rule-based Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) system **CarnyWise** (`CarnyWise.cs`) that continuously adapts challenge parameters to the player's performance, maintaining an optimal flow state during rehabilitation sessions.

The system was developed using a Human-Centered Design (HCD) methodology in collaboration with the **Rovisco Pais Rehabilitation Center** and validated through user testing with **38 participants**.

# 🎯 The Problem

Traditional post-stroke rehabilitation often suffers from low patient adherence due to the monotony of repetitive exercises and a lack of personalization in the therapeutic process.

---

# 💡 Our Approach

We propose a solution set in a VR Country Fair environment, designed to enhance stroke survivor motivation and engagement. The system utilizes:

- **Immersive Virtual Reality** and serious mini-games to combat demotivation and increase engagement among stroke survivors.
- A **rule-based Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)** system `CarnyWise` that adapts game parameters in real time based on stroke survivor performance (precision and time), promoting an optimal flow state via consecutive-attempt counters and configurable thresholds.
- **3D spatial audio** (via FMOD) to reinforce environmental immersion and provide directional feedback.
- **Hand-tracking interaction** on Meta Quest 3 — pinch gestures detected in `BowHandTracking.cs` with controller fallback — enabling natural gesture-based gameplay without controllers.
- **Personalized hub layout** — healthcare professionals can grab and rearrange mini-game tents (`MiniGameTent.cs`, `TentsPlaceHolderManager.cs`) before each session to set the desired activity order for the stroke survivor, using the Meta XR Distance Grab interaction.
- **Hybrid difficulty personalization via cheat codes** — beyond automated DDA, healthcare professionals can manually adjust the difficulty level at runtime using a keyboard cheat code system (`CheatCodes.cs`, `MiniGameCheatCodes.cs`), creating a **hybrid personalization model** that combines automatic adaptation with direct clinician control. The same system also exposes additional session management capabilities (skipping tutorial phases, triggering score/miss events, controlling the emotion display), though these fall outside the scope of personalization itself.
- **Networked emotion display** — a therapist-facing system streams stroke survivor emotional state in real time via TCP (`ServerListener.cs`) and Unity Netcode (`ExpressionDisplay.cs`, `SliderDisplay.cs`), with three randomly-selected display modes per session: emoji faces, facial expressions, and a cumulative mood slider.
- **Score and streak system** (`ScoreAndStreakSystem.cs`) with DOTween-animated UI feedback and session goal tracking.
- **JSON-driven dialogue system** (`UIDialog.cs`) for onboarding dialogues and tutorial flows, loading from `StreamingAssets/DialogFiles/`.

## Implemented Mini-games

- 🏹🎈 **Archery (`ArcheryGame.unity`):** A balloon-target shooting game where the player uses a virtual bow (hand-tracking via `BowHandTracking.cs`, trajectory preview via `TrajectoryLine.cs`). `ArcheryGameManager.cs` spawns colored balloons inside a defined volume and uses AnimationCurves to scale balloon count, movement ratio, transparency ratio, and movement speed with difficulty.
- 🥏🐶 **Frisbee (`FrisbeeGame.unity`):** A throwing game where the player tosses a frisbee for a dog to catch. `FrisbeeGameManager.cs` spawns score areas around the player at adaptive distances and uses AnimationCurves to control movement and visibility ratios. Dog AI is driven by a five-state FSM (`DogIdle`, `GoToTarget`, `Jump`, `CatchFrisbee`, `GiveFrisbeeToPlayer`).

# 🏗️ Architecture Overview

![Game Architecture Diagram](GameArch/GameArch.jpg)

### Singletons / Managers

| Class | Pattern | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `GameManager` | Singleton (non-MonoBehaviour) | Cross-scene session state flags (`IntroCompleted`, `FrisbeeTutorialCompleted`, `ArcheryTutorialCompleted`, `FrisbeeSessionCompleted`, `ArcherySessionCompleted`) |
| `AudioManager` | MonoBehaviour | FMOD event management for shared audio |
| `CountryFairAudioManager` | MonoBehaviour | Hub-world FMOD events |
| `MiniGameAudioManager` (abstract) | MonoBehaviour | Base for `FrisbeeAudioManager`, `ArcheryAudioManager` |

### Scene Composition

Three self-contained scenes connected by `SceneManager.LoadScene`:
- **`CountryFair`** → hub world, intro dialogue, tent selection/rearrangement
- **`ArcheryGame`** / **`FrisbeeGame`** → mini-game sessions; return to `CountryFair` on goal completion via `CarnyWise.SessionGoalReached()`

### Communication Patterns

- **`UnityEvent<T>`** primary cross-component wiring done in Inspector (e.g., `CarnyWise.changeDifficulty` → `MiniGameManager.ChangeDifficulty`, `ScoreAndStreakSystem.sessionGoalReached` → `CarnyWise.SessionGoalReached`)
- **`PlayerPrefs`** cross-scene persistence for difficulty levels (`FrisbeeDifficultyLevel`, `ArcheryDifficultyLevel`), dog distance (`DogDistance`), session goal (`SessionGoal`), and scoring color (`BalloonColorToScore`)
- **`NetworkVariable<T>`** (Unity Netcode) server-authoritative sync for `ExpressionDisplay` and `SliderDisplay`

### Finite State Machine (FSM)

`FSM.cs` / `State.cs` / `Transition.cs` a serializable FSM used by both animal ambients and mini-game actors:

```
State (abstract)
└── AnimatableState (adds Animator support)
    ├── AnimalState → AnimalWalk / AnimalEat / AnimalIdle  (needs-based, driven by AnimalUtility)
    ├── DogState    → DogIdle / GoToTarget / Jump / CatchFrisbee / GiveFrisbeeToPlayer
    └── FrisbeeState → OnPlayerFront / OnMovement / Landed
```

### DDA Loop (`CarnyWise.cs`)

```
Player scores / misses → PlayerScored() / PlayerMissed()
  → precision = 1 / attempts_until_score
  → EvaluatePerformance(precision, time)
  → _excelCounter / _struggleCounter updated
  → CheckToChangeDifficulty() (threshold: 3 consecutive)
  → changeDifficulty.Invoke(bool) → MiniGameManager.ChangeDifficulty()
  → ApplyDifficultySettings() → SyncTargets() + UpdateTargetsProperties()
```

Immediate decrease also fires if the player misses `failingConsecutiveThreshold` (default 4) times consecutively.

### Emotion Display System

`ServerListener` connects via TCP to an external emotion-recognition server, polling at `pollIntervalSeconds` (default 0.5 s). One of three display modes is randomly selected per session:
- **Emoji mode** `ExpressionDisplay` shows one of 7 expression GameObjects (SAD, HAPPY, ANGRY, DISGUST, SURPRISE, FEAR, NEUTRAL)
- **Face mode** second `ExpressionDisplay` instance with a different visual set
- **Slider mode** `SliderDisplay` nudges a cumulative mood bar up (POSITIVE) or down (NEGATIVE)

All three inherit `EmotionDisplay : NetworkBehaviour` and sync state via server-authoritative `NetworkVariable<T>`.

> **Note (testing):** For testing purposes, the emotion-recognition server address in `ServerListener` was set to a static IP.

### Web App Connection

`ConnectToWebApp.cs` connects the game to a companion web app (`CountryFairWebApp/ServerSide`, a Colyseus server) that lets a healthcare professional view/reorder the fair state live. The connection is plain `ws://`, no TLS — a deliberate choice, since the server is meant to run on the same PC whose Mobile Hotspot the headset joins, not on an untrusted network. See **`CLAUDE.md` → "Web App Connection & Cleartext Networking"** for the full setup (required Android/Player Settings, common device-build pitfalls) and the deployment caveat.

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| **Unity** | 6000.2.5f1 (Unity 6) |
| **Meta Quest 3** | Required for deployment |
| **Blender** *(optional)* | 4.3 or above for editing 3D models |
| **FMOD Studio** *(optional)* | 2.02.32 for editing audio events |

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DavidPalricas/CountryFair-VR.git
   ```
2. **Open in Unity Hub:** Add the cloned `CountryFair/` folder and ensure Unity **6000.2.5f1** is installed. Unity Hub will prompt to install it if missing.
3. **Resolve packages:** On first open, Unity imports packages from `Packages/manifest.json` (Meta XR SDK v78.0.0, XR Hands v1.5.1, XR OpenXR v1.15.1, Unity Netcode, DOTween). Allow the import to complete before interacting with the Editor.
4. **FMOD setup:** If FMOD banks are not pre-built, open FMOD Studio 2.02.32, load the project's FMOD project file, and build banks to `Assets/StreamingAssets/`.
5. **Run in Editor:** Open `Assets/Scenes/CountryFair.unity` as the start scene and press **Play**. For on-device testing, configure the Meta Quest 3 build profile under **File → Build Settings** (Android, OpenXR).
