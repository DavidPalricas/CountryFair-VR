# 🎯 The Problem
Traditional post-stroke rehabilitation often suffers from low patient adherence due to the monotony of repetitive exercises and a lack of personalization in the therapeutic process.

# 💡 Our Approach
We propose a solution set in a VR Country Fair environment, designed to enhance patient motivation and engagement. The system utilizes:
* Immersive Virtual Reality and serious mini-games to combat demotivation and increase engagement.

## Implemented Mini-games
* 🏹🎈 **Archery:** A game where the targets are balloons.
* 🥏🐶 **Frisbee:** A game where you throw a Frisbee into the dog's catch area.

# 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Unity** -> For game development
* **Blender** -> For modeling and animation
* **FMOD Studio** -> For 3D sound development

# ⚙️ Requirements
## Mandatory
* Meta Quest 3
* Unity Version 6000.2.5f1

## Optional
* Blender 4.3 or above
* FMOD Studio 2.02.32
